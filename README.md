Seats
=====

School project created for Mrs Potter's class. This program is meant to replace the current seating chart program in SkyWard. Adding names to a list, or generating a seating chart of numbers and referencing your current roster. You can print the seating chart, or save the file to work with/modify later. You can also include and exclude seats for odd desk  arrangements, and also make a list of problem students/students who should NOT be next to one another.
